# Getting Started

Welcome to **Shadow UI** â€” a customizable and modern React Native Design Sytemlibrary to build beautiful, consistent, and fast mobile apps.

## Installation

Since Shadow UI isn't published on npm yet, you can install it directly from GitHub:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/IbrahimXplorer/shadow-ui.git
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using components like:

```tsx
import {Button} from "@/components";
import React from "react";

const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <Button>
      <Button.Text title="Default" />
    </Button>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```
